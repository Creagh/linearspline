#' Fit linear regression splines to numeric data.

#' Linear spline regression works by fitting piece-wise linear 
#' functions to segments of the data between connecting points, 
#' called knots. One benefit of linear spline regression is that
#' it can produce a better local fit of the data between the knots.
